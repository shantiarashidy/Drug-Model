# Drug Model

This repository contains the code for a drug model designed to predict and classify drug-related data. The model achieves an F1 score of 1, indicating perfect classification performance.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting drug-related outcomes. The model has been trained and evaluated, and its performance metrics demonstrate exceptional accuracy.

## F1 Score

The model achieves an F1 score of 1, which is the best possible score, indicating that both precision and recall are perfectly balanced and there are no false positives or false negatives.

## Getting Started
